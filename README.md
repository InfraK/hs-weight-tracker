# hs-weight-tracker

Practice project to build a REST API using Haskell.

This was built incrementally to have some of the features that are expected in a real-world project, including:

- Pull configuration from environment variables
- Password hashing and verification using Argon2
- CRUD Database operations
- Database connection pooling
- Tests
- JSON serialization and parsing of I/O
- JWT-based authentication and protected endpoints
- Exception handling
- Local development environment using Docker and compose.
- Deployment image using Docker.
